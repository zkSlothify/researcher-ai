ðŸ”Œ Clients
Clients are core components in Eliza that enable AI agents to interact with external platforms and services. Each client provides a specialized interface for communication while maintaining consistent agent behavior across different platforms.

Overview
Clients serve as bridges between Eliza agents and various platforms, providing core capabilities:

Message Processing

Platform-specific message formatting and delivery
Media handling and attachments via Memory objects
Reply threading and context management
Support for different content types
State & Memory Management

Each client maintains independent state to prevent cross-platform contamination
Integrates with runtime memory managers for different types of content:
Messages processed by one client don't automatically appear in other clients' contexts
State persists across agent restarts through the database adapter
Platform Integration

Authentication and API compliance
Event processing and webhooks
Rate limiting and cache management
Platform-specific feature support

Client Configuration
Clients are configured through the Character configuration's clientConfig property:

export type Character = {
    // ... other properties ...
    clientConfig?: {
        discord?: {

            shouldIgnoreDirectMessages?: boolean;
            shouldRespondOnlyToMentions?: boolean;
            shouldOnlyJoinInAllowedGroups?: boolean;
            allowedGroupIds?: string[];
            messageSimilarityThreshold?: number;
            // ... other telegram-specific settings
        };
        slack?: {
            shouldIgnoreBotMessages?: boolean;
            shouldIgnoreDirectMessages?: boolean;
        };
        // ... other client configs
    };
};

Client Implementation
Each client manages its own:

Platform-specific message formatting and delivery
Event processing and webhooks
Authentication and API integration
Message queueing and rate limiting
Media handling and attachments
State management and persistence
Example of a basic client implementation:

import { Client, IAgentRuntime, ClientInstance } from "@elizaos/core";

export class CustomClient implements Client {
    name = "custom";
    
    async start(runtime: IAgentRuntime): Promise<ClientInstance> {
        // Initialize platform connection
        // Set up event handlers
        // Configure message processing

        return {
            stop: async () => {
                // Cleanup resources
                // Close connections
            }
        };
    }
}

Runtime Integration
Clients interact with the agent runtime through the IAgentRuntime interface, which provides:

Memory managers for different types of data storage
Service access for capabilities like transcription or image generation
State management and composition
Message processing and action handling
Memory System Integration
Clients use the runtime's memory managers to persist conversation data (source: memory.ts).

messageManager Chat messages
documentsManager File attachments
descriptionManager Media descriptions
See example

FAQ
What can clients actually do?
Clients handle platform-specific communication (like Discord messages or Twitter posts), manage memories and state, and execute actions like processing media or handling commands. Each client adapts these capabilities to its platform while maintaining consistent agent behavior.

Can multiple clients be used simultaneously?
Yes, Eliza supports running multiple clients concurrently while maintaining consistent agent behavior across platforms.

How are client-specific features handled?
Each client implements platform-specific features through its capabilities system, while maintaining a consistent interface for the agent.

How co clients handle rate limits?
Clients implement platform-specific rate limiting with backoff strategies and queue management.

How is client state managed?
Clients maintain their own connection state while integrating with the agent's runtime database adapter and memory / state management system.

How do clients handle messages?
Clients translate platform messages into Eliza's internal format, process any attachments (images, audio, etc.), maintain conversation context, and manage response queuing and rate limits.

How are messages processed across clients?
Each client processes messages independently in its platform-specific format, while maintaining conversation context through the shared memory system. V2 improves upon this architecture.

How is state managed between clients?
Each client maintains separate state to prevent cross-contamination, but can access shared agent state through the runtime.

How do clients integrate with platforms?
Each client implements platform-specific authentication, API compliance, webhook handling, and follows the platform's rules for rate limiting and content formatting.

How do clients manage memory?
Clients use Eliza's memory system to track conversations, user relationships, and state, enabling context-aware responses and persistent interactions across sessions.
