# Research AI Agent 

### Specification, Roadmap, and Feature List

## 1\. Overview

The Research & KOL AI Agent is designed to serve as a comprehensive news aggregator, deep research tool, and KOL (Key Opinion Leader) assistant, initially focused on the @movementlabsxyz ecosystem and the Move programming language.  
The agent aggregates data from multiple sources (X/Twitter, Discord, YouTube, Spaces, podcasts) to generate insights, news highlights, alpha, and content ideas.  
Its modular architecture will allow for expansion into other niches by simply modifying topics and source lists.

#### **Tech Stack Overview (to be determined)**

* **ElizaOS (TypeScript/Node.js):** Core framework for building and managing autonomous AI agents.  
* **Supabase (PostgreSQL):** Persistent storage for agent configurations, logs, and historical state.  
* **BullMQ:** Node.js-based task scheduler for handling asynchronous background tasks. (alternatively N8N?)  
* **Optional Vector Database:** For advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) if enhanced semantic search is required. (**pgvector (most likely)**, pinecone, weaviate, or chromadb?)

---

## 2\. Core Objectives

* **Alpha Discovery & Research**: Automatically extract and analyze data from social media and online sources.  
* **Content Generation & Strategy**: Use AI to generate **summary posts, thread ideas, deep-dive articles, and discover alpha**.  
* **Community Engagement**: Empower users with AI-generated insights to enhance research and discovery. Keep up with the ecosystem news easily without constantly checking X and uncover alpha in one place.  
* **KOL Positioning**: The agent‚Äôs X account will serve as a thought leader, providing invaluable content and insights, working 24/7 to ensure the community doesn‚Äôt miss anything. It enables the admin to run a KOL account for a niche topic or ecosystem with the help of AI operating around the clock.

* Follow specified **X (Twitter) accounts, hashtags, and token tickers**.  
* Auto-crawl **linked articles** from tweets for additional context and data.

#### **Manual Information Input**

* Admins can manually add information by copying and pasting text along with comments (e.g., "so and so username from X company says this about Movement Labs"). The agent adds this data to its database for consideration.

#### **Transcript Extraction**

* Extract transcripts from **YouTube and Twitter Spaces URLs**, then process them using AI for insights and summarization.

---

### **AI Processing & Insights Generation**

#### **Automated Summaries**

* Post **key highlights, alpha, ecosystem summaries, and important dates** at adjustable intervals (**e.g., every 24 hours**).

#### **Content Strategy Suggestions**

* Analyze content and engagement data to recommend **high-impact** post topics and article/thread ideas.

#### **Deep Research & Sentiment Analysis**

* Use **NLP** to detect trends, sentiment, and narratives.  
* Track a **separate set of X accounts** to monitor broader web3 industry news and sentiment beyond the Movement ecosystem.

---

### **Interaction & Workflow**

* Private chat for **admin commands** (e.g., ‚ÄúGenerate a thread idea‚Äù or ‚ÄúWrite a post on {topic}‚Äù).  
* Allow **partners with a special role** to drop **information and alpha** into a **private Discord channel**, where:  
  * Admins can manually add information by copying and pasting text along with comments (e.g., "so and so username from X company says this about Movement Labs"). The agent **adds this data** to its database for consideration.  
  * The AI **determines whether it‚Äôs worth sharing** on X.

#### **Admin & Moderation Controls**

* **Approval workflow**: The agent pings **admins** in Discord with generated content for:  
  * **Approval & posting**  
  * **Editing**  
  * **Rejection**  
* **Command-based configuration/settings** (e.g., ‚ÄúEvery 24 hours, create a draft of the ecosystem highlight summary thread based on tweets from the past 24 hours.‚Äù).  
* The agent will send a digest of pending approvals to a dedicated Discord channel. 

#### **Automated Posting**

* Once **approved on Discord**, content can be:  
  * **Scheduled** for later publishing.  
  * **Published immediately** to the agent‚Äôs account on X.  
  * Create settings to auto publish certain content types with commands

## **Final Thoughts**

This AI-powered Research & KOL Agent is designed to amplify ecosystem intelligence and streamline research. As it evolves, it will incorporate deeper AI-driven analytics, multi-agent collaboration, and improved workflow automation, ensuring continuous growth and scalability.

**Updates**

The full vision outlined above is my ideal **Version 1**, but I want to **break it down into smaller, manageable steps**.

#### **Immediate Focus**

1. **Twitter Data Aggregation**  
   * Pull data from **a third-party API** that collects tweets, threads, quote tweets, and replies/comments from a specified list of users.  
   * Link to API documentation: [(also provided as a json file)](https://docs.socialdata.tools/reference/get-user-tweets-replies/)  
     [https://docs.socialdata.tools/reference/get-user-tweets-replies/](https://docs.socialdata.tools/reference/get-user-tweets-replies/)  
2. **AI-Driven Insights & Summarization**  
   * AI will **identify potential alpha** and generate **daily & weekly highlights**.  
   * It will **rank** information based on significance and **retain the original source links** for easy reference when posting summaries on Twitter.  
3. **YouTube & X Spaces Transcript Extraction**  
   * I've created a **Python script** that enables users to submit a URL from **X Spaces or YouTube**.  
   * The script **automatically downloads the audio** and **extracts the text** for further AI processing.

#### **Format for Summaries**

The **24-hour and weekly recaps** will follow this structure:
