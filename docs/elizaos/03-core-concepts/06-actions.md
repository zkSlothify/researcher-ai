âš¡ Actions
Actions define how agents respond to and interact with messages. They enable agents to perform tasks beyond simple message responses by integrating with external systems and modifying behavior.

Overview
Structure:
An Action consists of:

name: Unique identifier
similes: Alternative names/triggers
description: Purpose and usage explanation
validate: Function to check if action is appropriate
handler: Core implementation logic
examples: Sample usage patterns
suppressInitialMessage: Optional flag to suppress initial response
Validation:
Checks if the action can be executed
Consider conversation state
Validate required
Implementation
interface Action {
    name: string;
    similes: string[];
    description: string;
    examples: ActionExample[][];
    handler: Handler;
    validate: Validator;
    suppressInitialMessage?: boolean;
}

Basic Action Template
const customAction: Action = {
    name: "CUSTOM_ACTION",
    similes: ["ALTERNATE_NAME", "OTHER_TRIGGER"],
    description: "Detailed description of when and how to use this action",
    validate: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory) => {
        // Validation logic
        return true;
    },
    handler: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory) => {
        // Implementation logic
        return true;
    },
    examples: [
        [
            {
                user: "{{user1}}",
                content: { text: "Trigger message" },
            },
            {
                user: "{{user2}}",
                content: { text: "Response", action: "CUSTOM_ACTION" },
            },
        ],
    ],
};


Character File Example
Actions can be used in character files as well. Here's an example from: https://github.com/elizaOS/characters/blob/main/sbf.character.json

    "messageExamples": [
        [
            {
                "user": "{{user1}}",
                "content": {
                    "text": "Can you help transfer some SOL?"
                }
            },
            {
                "user": "SBF",
                "content": {
                    "text": "yeah yeah for sure, sending SOL is pretty straightforward. just need the recipient and amount. everything else is basically fine, trust me.",
                    "action": "SEND_SOL"
                }
            }
        ],

Image Generation Action
Here's a comprehensive example of an image generation action:

import { Action, IAgentRuntime, Memory, State } from "@elizaos/core";

// Example image generation action
const generateImageAction: Action = {
    name: "GENERATE_IMAGE", 
    similes: ["CREATE_IMAGE", "MAKE_IMAGE", "DRAW"],
    description: "Generates an image based on the user's description",
    suppressInitialMessage: true, // Suppress initial response since we'll generate our own

    // Validate if this action should be used
    validate: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory) => {
        const text = message.content.text.toLowerCase();
        // Check if message contains image generation triggers
        return (
            text.includes("generate") ||
            text.includes("create") ||
            text.includes("draw") ||
            text.includes("make an image")
        );
    },

    // Handle the action execution
    handler: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory, state?: State) => {
        try {
            // Get image service
            const imageService = runtime.getService(ServiceType.IMAGE_GENERATION);
            
            // Generate image
            const imageUrl = await imageService.generateImage(message.content.text);

            // Create response with generated image
            await runtime.messageManager.createMemory({
                id: generateId(),
                content: {
                    text: "Here's the image I generated:",
                    attachments: [{
                        type: "image",
                        url: imageUrl
                    }]
                },
                userId: runtime.agentId,
                roomId: message.roomId,
            });

            return true;
        } catch (error) {
            console.error("Image generation failed:", error);
            return false;
        }
    },

    // Example usage patterns
    examples: [
        [
            {
                user: "{{user1}}",
                content: { 
                    text: "Can you generate an image of a sunset?" 
                }
            },
            {
                user: "{{user2}}",
                content: {
                    text: "I'll create that image for you",
                    action: "GENERATE_IMAGE"
                }
            }
        ]
    ]
};


Basic Conversation Actions
You can find these samples in the plugin-bootstrap package: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/tree/main/packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/actions

CONTINUE
For continuing conversations:

const continueAction: Action = {
    name: "CONTINUE",
    similes: ["ELABORATE", "GO_ON"],
    description: "Continues the conversation when appropriate",

    validate: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory) => {
        // Check if message warrants continuation
        const text = message.content.text.toLowerCase();
        return (
            text.includes("tell me more") ||
            text.includes("what else") ||
            text.includes("continue") ||
            text.endsWith("?")
        );
    },

    handler: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory, state?: State) => {
        // Get recent conversation context
        const recentMessages = await runtime.messageManager.getMemories({
            roomId: message.roomId,
            count: 5
        });

        // Generate contextual response
        const response = await runtime.generateResponse(
            message,
            recentMessages,
            state
        );

        // Store response
        await runtime.messageManager.createMemory({
            id: generateId(),
            content: response,
            userId: runtime.agentId,
            roomId: message.roomId
        });

        return true;
    },

    examples: [
        [
            {
                user: "{{user1}}",
                content: { text: "Tell me more about that" }
            },
            {
                user: "{{user2}}",
                content: {
                    text: "I'll continue explaining...",
                    action: "CONTINUE"
                }
            }
        ]
    ]
};


IGNORE
For ending conversations:

const ignoreAction: Action = {
    name: "IGNORE",
    similes: ["STOP_TALKING", "END_CONVERSATION"],
    description: "Stops responding when conversation is complete or irrelevant",

    validate: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory) => {
        const text = message.content.text.toLowerCase();
        return (
            text.includes("goodbye") ||
            text.includes("bye") ||
            text.includes("thanks") ||
            text.length < 2
        );
    },

    handler: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory) => {
        // No response needed
        return true;
    },

    examples: [
        [
            {
                user: "{{user1}}",
                content: { text: "Thanks, goodbye!" }
            },
            {
                user: "{{user2}}",
                content: {
                    text: "",
                    action: "IGNORE"
                }
            }
        ]
    ]
};


FAQ
What are Actions in Eliza?
Actions are core building blocks that define how agents interact with messages and perform tasks beyond simple text responses.

How do Actions work?
Actions consist of a name, description, validation function, and handler function that determine when and how an agent can perform a specific task.

What can Actions do?
Actions enable agents to interact with external systems, modify behavior, process complex workflows, and extend capabilities beyond conversational responses.

What are some example Actions?
Common actions include CONTINUE (extend dialogue), IGNORE (end conversation), GENERATE_IMAGE (create images), TRANSFER (move tokens), and READ_CONTRACT (retrieve blockchain data).

How do I create a custom Action?
Define an action with a unique name, validation function to check eligibility, handler function to implement the logic, and provide usage examples.

What makes a good Action?
A good action has a clear, single purpose, robust input validation, comprehensive error handling, and provides meaningful interactions.

Can Actions be chained together?
Yes, actions can be composed and chained to create complex workflows and multi-step interactions.

How are Actions different from tools?
Actions are more comprehensive, ensuring the entire process happens, while tools are typically more focused on specific, discrete operations.

Where are Actions defined?
Actions can be defined in character files, plugins, or directly in agent configurations.
